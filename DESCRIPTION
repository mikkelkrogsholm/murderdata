Description: With data from the Murder Accountability Project you can determine 
    how often police departments in american communities clear a homicide through 
    arrest using the clearances data. You can also explore individual cases 
    reported to the FBI or obtained by the Murder Accountability Project under 
    local Freedom of Information Acts. Using the supplementary data, you can look 
    for patterns in the occurrence of specific types of homicides and how often 
    police identified the offender. Read more at <http://murderdata.org/>.
